#WalletLepp
This application is made in order to digitize the loyalty cards of the users in one electronic wallet.
#The first major functionality is to enable the users to scan the barcode / qr code with the help of the camera #and to have that card always at hand. 
#The second functionality of the application is to sort the scanned cards from the wallet (Dashboard) according to the current location of the user device using Google Play services.
#And if the application detects that the user is at a distance of 60 meters from the exact location the application automatically suggests a barcode on the card in a pop-up dialog.
